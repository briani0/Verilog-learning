//the way a ripple-carry adder works is that basically it is summing the bits at a given iteration (a & b), but what i just learned by watching a youtube video on the adder is that the new carry-in is the carry-out from the previous iteration
//this was able to work using combinational logic with the always block even though it said to use a generate statement, I will ask Madhav about this
